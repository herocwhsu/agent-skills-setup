# Decisions

Superseded or historical decisions. A decision that still binds stays in `PROGRESS.md` under "Decisions Made"; when it stops binding, move it here with its reasoning.

## From lectures 1 to 3

- **Did not add a fake "one feature at a time" placeholder feature list**:
  this repo is an ongoing multi-skill toolkit, not a single-feature build, so a
  literal `feature_list.json` reflects real completed/queued work instead of a
  templated placeholder. See `AGENTS.md` for this repo's actual working rules.
- **`init.sh` delegates rather than reimplements**: `scripts/harness-verify.sh`
  is already this repo's single source of truth for verification gates (same
  checks the Stop hooks run). A second implementation in `init.sh` would drift
  from it the first time either changed.
- **Removed a broken `ask` permission rule rather than patching it wider**:
  `codex-kiro` (a genuinely different model) found `Bash(bash scripts/install.sh*)`
  trivially bypassed by any other invocation form. Enumerating every bypass is
  not a stable boundary, so `AGENTS.md` now documents that boundary as
  advisory-only instead of pretending an unenforceable rule enforces it.
- **Only 2 of ~400 bare `python3`/`mypy`/`pytest` call sites were pointed at
  the new `.venv`**: everything else either ships to other people's machines
  (installer scripts, credential helpers, hook templates copied into other
  repos) and must keep resolving from ambient PATH, or only imports stdlib
  and needs no third-party package at all. Confirmed via a full call-site
  audit before touching anything, not assumed.
- **Brought in a third model (`agy`) specifically because `codex-kiro` had
  just failed once**: a single review tool's reliability wobble is a real
  reason to add a second source, not just retry the same one. That review
  paid off with a genuine finding (version-drift gap) — but also produced
  two confident, false claims from `agy` itself, reinforcing that a third
  model is one more source to verify, not one more source to trust by
  default.
- **`google-generativeai` deprecation confirmed but not migrated** (migrated later in feat-019): real,
  checked against PyPI directly, not just claimed by either review model —
  but migrating it means touching `polish_engine.py`'s actual Gemini
  integration code, a different-shaped change than this session's
  dev-tooling scope. Flagged in Blockers/Risks rather than silently
  expanded into or silently dropped.
- **Redesigned the exclusion test rather than accepting the first null
  result**: attempt 1 (mirror a sibling file) was fully answerable from the
  sibling alone, so stripping Instructions/State/Feedback never got
  exercised — a null result about the task, not about the subsystems.
  Attempt 2 deliberately chose a task with real ambiguity, a non-obvious
  stopping point, and a mechanically verifiable outcome (a new gate across
  4 integration points) instead of a bigger or different-repo task — size
  wasn't the problem, shortcut-ability was.
- **Caught and excluded a confound rather than reporting all 4 conditions
  as comparable**: the no-feedback variant's ablation (delete
  `scripts/tests/` to remove Feedback) happened to also delete the file
  containing the pre-existing bug the other 3 conditions found. Its silence
  on that bug is an artifact of the ablation, not a finding, and it was
  explicitly excluded from that comparison rather than silently averaged in.
- **Recorded the exclusion-test result as a correlation, not a proven
  cause**: `AGENTS.md`'s presence correlates with fixing (not just
  flagging) an incidentally-found bug, cross-validated across 3 independent
  sandboxes finding the identical bug — but `AGENTS.md` has no instruction
  resembling "fix bugs you find along the way" (checked directly, no
  match), so the causal mechanism is explicitly left unconfirmed rather
  than overclaimed.
